# Agent-based COVID-19 simulation

This software implements an agent-based (or individual-based) model for simulating
the spread of the coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) in a healthcare district.

It models healthcare capacity (hospital beds and ICU units) and different
public health simulations.


## Installation

Install a Python venv with Python 3.7 or 3.8. Install the requirements:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


## Usage

Run the simulation with:

```
python -m calc.simulation
```

Or visualize using Dash:

```
python -m corona
```
